<i>[Wikipedia]  [Basic introduction] </i>Â <br />

Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. <br />

So in other words we can describe AI as a system ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks throguh flexible adaptation. <br /> 


<b>Reasoning, problem solving</b> <br />

Early researchers developed algorithms that imitaed step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. BY the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had develped methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics. <br />
